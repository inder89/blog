This is JavaScript univer where values are not inside my code but rather outside my code in the universe.

Primitive values are the farthest from my code whereas objects and functions are the closest to my code. One reason could be that they are the biggest paintbrushes with which to paint the code. There is nothing I can do in my code that would affect them. Primitve values are like stars-cold and instant, but always there when I need them.
